# Flappy Bird Python Game
This is a simple game I made in Python

## Setup Instructions

1. Grab the latest release of Python.
2. Install Pygame by executing pip install pygame.
3. Ensure main.py is in the same directory as ./data and execute python main.py.

*Note* - If the pip install pygame did not work for you, then try this:

**Windows**: python -m pip install pygame

**Mac**: python3 -m pip install pygame

**Linux**: Same as windows.

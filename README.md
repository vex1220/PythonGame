# PythonGame
Simple game I made in Python


Grab the latest release of Python and install Pygame by executing pip install pygame.

Note: If the pip install pygame did not work for you, then try this:

Windows: python -m pip install pygame

Mac: python3 -m pip install pygame

Linux: Same as windows.

Ensure main.py is in the same directory as ./data and execute python main.py.
